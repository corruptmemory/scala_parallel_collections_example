# Trivial Scala Parallel Collections Example

Highly trivial example of the [Scala Parallel Collections](http://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/150220/files/pc.pdf) capability.  Counts words containing 2 consecutive vowels using "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland" as input.

Uses [SBT 0.10](https://github.com/harrah/xsbt), so go get some.

Once SBT has been gotten fire it up and type `run`.
